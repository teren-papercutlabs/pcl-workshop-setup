# 6 Principles for Working with Claude

## 1. Describe the problem, not the solution

Don't tell Claude HOW to do something. Tell it WHAT you're trying to achieve. Let Claude figure out the approach.

**Instead of:** "Write a Python script that uses pandas to read a CSV and filter rows where column A > 10"

**Try:** "I have a CSV with sales data. I need to find all transactions over $10."

## 2. Output not right? Ask why, iterate, codify

When Claude's output isn't what you wanted:
1. Ask Claude WHY it did what it did
2. Iterate on the prompt until you get what you want
3. Codify the lesson (add to CLAUDE.md, create a skill, etc.)

The goal: never have the same misunderstanding twice.

## 3. Confirm alignment before Claude acts

Before Claude makes changes, make sure you're on the same page. Ask Claude to explain its plan. Catch misunderstandings BEFORE work is done, not after.

---

## 4. Push past the first "no"

Claude will sometimes say it can't do something, or hedge with "I don't have access to..." Push back. Ask if there's another way. Often there is.

## 5. Try not to do anything yourself

Force yourself to delegate everything to Claude, even things you could do faster manually. This is how you learn Claude's limits and capabilities.

If you find yourself thinking "it's faster if I just do this myself" — stop. That's exactly when you should ask Claude.

## 6. Lower your bar for what's worth automating

Small annoyances compound. That thing you do 3 times a day that takes 20 seconds? That's worth automating.

Agentic thinking means recognizing friction everywhere and eliminating it.
